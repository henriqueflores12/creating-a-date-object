# creating-a-date-object

in this example a new date object is created using the date() object constructor it is called today
if you do not specify a date when creating a date object it will contain the date and time when the javascript interpreter
encounters that line of code once you have an instance of the date object (holding the current date and time),you can use any of its properties or methods
in this example you can see that getFullYear()is used to return the year of the date being stored in the date object
in this case it is being used to write the current year in a copyright statement.
